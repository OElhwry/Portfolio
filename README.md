# Omar Elhawary — Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio!  
This site showcases my projects, experience, and a bit about me — built from scratch using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

---

## Overview

This portfolio is a reflection of my journey as a developer, combining clean design, motion, and code into one cohesive experience.  
It’s designed to be simple, fast, and visually focused, while keeping accessibility and responsiveness in mind.

You’ll find:
- **About section** — who I am, what I do, and what drives me  
- **Experience** — a few roles I’ve taken on, including work with Winter Wonderland and the NHS  
- **Projects** — apps I’ve built such as *PeerFit* and *Explore Space*  
- **Contact & Links** — ways to connect with me through GitHub and LinkedIn

## Inspiration

This portfolio draws design inspiration from [Brittany Chiang](https://v4.brittanychiang.com/), whose portfolio layout and user experience really stood out to me.  
I admired her focus on subtle motion, structured typography, and minimalist design, and decided to recreate a similar layout while giving it my own style and content.

I’ve rewritten the components, adjusted the structure, and customized every section to reflect **my personal brand, projects, and technical stack**.  
All styling, animations, and configurations were rebuilt independently in **Next.js 14 (App Router)** with full **TypeScript** support.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js (App Router)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Images:** Next.js `<Image>` optimization
